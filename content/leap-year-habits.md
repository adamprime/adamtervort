The peg-legged month of February is quickly upon us, and this year its gait is even more angular than normal. To all of you born on February 29, happy birthday. Itâ€™s been four years coming. ðŸ¥³

February is as good a time as any to start something new. Austin Kleon has a fun [29 Day Challenge](https://austinkleon.com/2020/01/31/29-day-challenge/) on his site that I like the look of. Since February is the shortest month itâ€™s way easier to start a new habit in than January, right? (At least February doesnâ€™t feel like it lasts forever as January sometimes does.)

Pick a habit you want to start, [print off the sheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b7xrffwydt51y3h/29-day-challenge.pdf?dl=0), and cross off the days you accomplish it. [Donâ€™t Break the Chain!](https://lifehacker.com/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret-281626) Iâ€™m going to work on [Intermittent Fasting](https://adamtervort.com/intermittent-fasting/) every day.
