I haven’t written much this month. With everything going on in the world, taking the time to write a post each day seemed almost self absorbed. I wanted to keep my family close and focus on helping them and others in my community. This week I’ve started to feel that our new, stay-at-home normal has reached the point of equilibrium and I have some mental space to start writing again.

What I have been doing a lot this month is reading. Sites like [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/), [Raptitude](https://www.raptitude.com/), [Barking up the Wrong Tree](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/), and [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/) have helped a lot. I hope something of what I write helps others in the way these writers (and many others) have helped me.

[Steven Pressfield](https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/03/pandemic-a-poem-by-lynn-ungar/) shared this excellent poem by [Lynn Ungar](http://www.lynnungar.com/poems/pandemic/). It's so good I want to pass it along to you. I hope during this time of disruption we can find positive change as we reach out to each other with our hearts.

## Pandemic

What if you thought of it <br>
as the Jews consider the Sabbath— <br>
the most sacred of times? <br>
Cease from travel. <br>
Cease from buying and selling. <br>
Give up, just for now, <br>
on trying to make the world <br>
different than it is. <br>
Sing. Pray. Touch only those <br>
to whom you commit your life. <br>
Center down. <br>

And when your body has become still, <br>
reach out with your heart. <br>
Know that we are connected <br>
in ways that are terrifying and beautiful. <br>
(You could hardly deny it now.) <br>
Know that our lives <br>
are in one another’s hands. <br>
(Surely, that has come clear.) <br>
Do not reach out your hands. <br>
Reach out your heart. <br>
Reach out your words. <br>
Reach out all the tendrils <br>
of compassion that move, invisibly, <br>
where we cannot touch. <br>

Promise this world your love– <br>
for better or for worse, <br>
in sickness and in health, <br>
so long as we all shall live.

–Lynn Ungar 3/11/20
