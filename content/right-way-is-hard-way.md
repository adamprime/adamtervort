Worthwhile pursuits are hard. Work worth doing involves struggle. This is one of the lessons I wish I had learned earlier in life.

This afternoon I saw a perfect example of this. We had a small, Friday afternoon emergency at work. A customer needed a very specific data set that I knew was in our database but that I didn’t know how to retrieve. A coworker stepped up and saved the day.

She has been studying a monster book called *[SQL for Mere Mortals](https://bookshop.org/books/sql-queries-for-mere-mortals-a-hands-on-guide-to-data-manipulation-in-sql/9780134858333) [(public library)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/sql-queries-for-mere-mortals-a-hands-on-guide-to-data-manipulation-in-sql/oclc/1023657978).* This is not light reading. It’s the kind of book you should never read while laying on your back—if you fall asleep and it drops on your face it’ll break your nose.  I know studying it has been a chore.

She crafted a query that gave us exactly what we needed. The hard work she’s been putting in paid off.

In a [recent interview](https://hbr.org/2017/01/lifes-work-jerry-seinfeld%E2%80%8B) Jerry Seinfeld said “If you’re efficient, you’re doing it the wrong way. The right way is the hard way. The show was successful because I micromanaged it—every word, every line, every take, every edit, every casting. That’s my way of life.”

Embracing hard work and the focus needed to do hard work is unusual. Most people don’t work this way. But if we want to accomplish great things it’s the right path.
