On my computer I love the option to have a window take up the entire screen. Not just to maximize it to cover the desktop, but filling the entire screen. As I write this I have only one window visible, no menu bar or icons in the dock. Do Not Disturb mode is enabled. Right now this computer is only capable of doing one thing.

Knowledge work, the kind of work many of us do all day, revolves around writing. For hundreds of years writing was a pretty simple task. Whether it was a letter, a recipe, or a novel, the person writing had a pen and some paper. The paper could be a loose sheet or part of a bound book. The pen could be a fountain pen or a quill or a ballpoint. The essential ingredients for this kind of work were simple.

When typewriters became popular it meant a new tool was being used, but the essential task was the same. One sheet of paper and one typewriter. The writer pressed on keys, letters and symbols were imprinted on the paper, and that was that. It wasn't very efficient and if you made a mistake it meant some sort of manual correction, but that's not all that different from working with a pen and paper. 

Computers and mobile devices changed this. Fixing mistakes was so easy! Press a key and delete the mistake. Sharing the work was much easier too. Email meant the cost was effectively zero to send your writing to someone and the speed was basically instant.

Technology made things better in so many ways, but it has also changed the equation. Rather than **facilitating** the basic tasks we do, it actively **tries to take our attention away** from that task. How many of the notifications that you receive on your phone do you really need to know about right now? How often does a ping take you away from something you are doing in real life?

I don't know that I have very many answers, but I know that when I purposely set up my computer so that my focus is on only one thing at a time (a single window and the single task I'm doing in that window) I get much more done.

It seems counter intuitive to work this way. Computers have trained us all to try and multi-task. They call out that this is the only way to do knowledge work. It must be right!

Just remember that long before computers dinged for every email and pinged for every new YouTube video, people like you have been getting work done by single tasking. You don't have to revert to pen and paper or a typewriter to get the benefits that kind of work brings.
