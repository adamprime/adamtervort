One of my favorite aspects of modern computers is the ability to have a window take up the entire screen. Not just most of the screen or all of the desktop, but to take up the entire screen. As I write this I have only one window visible, no menu bar or icons in the dock. Do Not Disturb mode is enabled. For all intents and purposes, at this moment, this computer is only capable of doing one thing.

Writing, no matter if it was a letter, a recipe, or a novel, used to be like this all of the time. The person writing had a pen and some paper. Maybe the paper was a loose sheet and maybe it was part of a bound book. The pen could be a fountain pen or a quill or a ballpoint. The essential ingredients for "knowledge work" were simple. 

When typewriters became popular it meant a new tool was being used, but the essential task was the same. One sheet of paper and one typewriter. The writer pressed on keys, letters and symbols were imprinted on the paper, and that was that. It wasn't very efficient and if you made a mistake it meant some sort of manual correction, but that's not all that different from working with a pen and paper. The same problem existed then too.

Computers and later mobile devices changed these work scenarios. Fixing mistakes was so easy! Press a key, delete the mistake and then retype it. Sending the work was much easier too. Email meant the cost was effectively zero to send your writing to another human being and the speed was effectively instant. (Yes, there is a small delay, but it's not even comparable to the delay in sending paper from one person to another.)

Technology made things better in so many ways, but it has also changed the equation. Rather than facilitating the basic tasks we do, it actively tries to take our attention away from that task. How many of the notifications that you receive on your phone are actually the type of thing you need to know about right this minute? How often does a notification take you away from something you are doing in real life for something on your device that's not really important?

I don't know that I have very many answers, but I know that when I purposely set up my computer so that my focus is on only one thing at a time (a single window and the single task I'm doing in that window) I get much more done. 

It seems counter intuitive to work this way. Ever since Windows 95 the computers I've used have tried to get me to multi-task. We've all been trained that this is the way you work when you're doing knowledge work. Just remember that long before your computer gave you the option to ding every time an email came in or a new video was uploaded to YouTube, people like you have been doing their work by single tasking. You don't have to revert to pen and paper or a typewriter to get the benefits that kind of work brings.
