Setting up systems is one of the quickest ways to improve efficiency. Experience within a system shows us how to improve the system itself.

A few weeks ago I went to a community organization to pick up some supplies. Their offering was well received and a lot of people showed up around the same time as me. It was terrible. The line was long, the service was slow, and everyone was grumpy. I felt bad for the people in the organization. They were doing their best to help everyone, but they really didn't know how to handle the situation and it made the experience terrible for everyone involved.

I debated whether or not I would go back the next week, but decided to give it another try. The second week was much better. They learned from the mistakes of the first week and had a much more robust and efficient system set up. The wait time was reduced, time in line was used for tasks that would speed up time at the front of the line, and the volunteers were better trained.

By the fourth week it was a well oiled machine. One of the fun things to watch as I stood in line was how the experienced volunteers trained the new ones. Unlike the first week when everyone was new and there was quite a bit of discussion about methods and on-the-fly changes, now the volunteers with experience trained the new volunteers on how the system works and why. There wasn't much discussion between them, but the questions new volunteers asked were answered from a place of experience.

In our work, we should look for ways to put systems in place that improve processes and increase efficiency. But don't overlook the value of tweaking the system based on experiences within it. Those small changes can be the difference between a good customer experience and a great one.
