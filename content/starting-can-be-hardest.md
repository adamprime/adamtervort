Recently I've seen a trend in my life: it's hard to get things done. Doing the little things that add up over time seems much harder than before. None of these things are new or difficult. I'm talking about working out, writing, meditating, or reading.

As I've pondered why, the common thread I see is trouble getting started. The things I want to do are easy. I've done them all before, most many times. Once I start a workout I have no problem completing it. I enjoy writing once I start. The stumbling block is just getting going.

I don't think I'm alone. 2020 has done a number on all of us in one way or another. At some point, however, we need to reestablish a new normal. That can be painful. Humans have an amazing ability to avoid pain. My goal for July is to push past avoiding pain and establish a new rhythm. To find my new normal despite discomfort.

I believe that one of the keys to success is daily actions. Don't let the fear or discomfort of starting hold you back from gaining the long term benefits they will bring.
