I love to read the text of great speeches. There is a different quality in masterful oratory than we find in books or articles. It stirs the soul and inspires. Below are links to speeches that I enjoyed and wanted to share. Some are recent and some are older. When available, Iâ€™ve included a link to any further resources such as audio or video of the speech.
