It‚Äôs the nature of being human that we will have bad days. And sometimes bad weeks. Or bad months. Maybe even bad years. 

The list of things that can go wrong or happen to us seems endless. (Not trying to be a downer here, but it‚Äôs true!) There is real pain and suffering in the world and it happens to me and you.

The good news is that we are never alone and that we always have a choice.

Go to friends, family, or professionals when you need help. You are not alone! Just knowing that can makes a world of difference.

As Marcus Aurelius said, ‚ÄúOur actions may be impeded but there can be no impeding our intentions or dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.‚Äù 

Whatever is standing in your way, use it to help you move forward.
