One of the hardest aspects of work for me is when I know I have a hard task to do. I‚Äôve found some psychological trickery that works well on me that might be useful for you too.

I‚Äôm a big fan of the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique). There are lots of ways to implement it, but the basic premise is to work for 25 minutes, then take a five minute break. After four 25 minute work periods then take a longer break. 

The reason this helps me is because no matter how hard the entirety of the task is, I know I can work for 25 minutes. It‚Äôs embarrassing how often I have to tell myself that any old dummy can work for 25 minutes, or that after I do one pomodoro I‚Äôll quit and work on something else. Starting is the hardest part. Once I get going I nearly always find that I‚Äôm surprised by the timer going off, and starting the second, third, and subsequent pomodoros is never a challenge. 

There is a lot of interesting research into why a technique like this, and I consider this a form of [batching](https://kresserinstitute.com/batching-simple-strategy-boosting-brainpower-increasing-productivity/), works so well. Beating resistance and getting started is so important. Getting started early is important. Perhaps the most important aspect of this for me is that I may not see a path to success for a large project, but I know I can win if the game is simply to work for 25 minutes. I‚Äôm not worried about winning the whole war, just winning this one little battle.
