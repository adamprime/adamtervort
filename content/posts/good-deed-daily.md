One of my New Year's goals this year is to do a good deed daily.
<!--more-->

It changes my day when I have a goal like this top of mind. I set out with the thought that I want to be helpful and do some good for the people around me. There have been a few times when I was able to do something significant, but generally it‚Äôs small things: holding a door for someone, smiling at people, taking the time to talk, and sharing some of what I know.

A side benefit I‚Äôve discovered is I‚Äôm more aware of the good things people around me do. When I see someone going out of their way to be nice or serve someone I feel like I‚Äôm meeting a fellow member of a secret club. It feels great to see the good that others do, and helps reaffirm my desire to keep doing good too. Faith in humanity confirmed!
