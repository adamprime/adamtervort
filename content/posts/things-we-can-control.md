As I write this I‚Äôm listening to three student jazz groups playing. (I have one child in each group so I sit in between the three rehearsal rooms so I can catch snatches of each group as they play.) 

Last week these groups held auditions. One of the students who auditioned got his placement today and wasn‚Äôt willing to accept it. He is the oldest bass player that tried out but was placed in the lowest of the three groups. I understand where he‚Äôs coming from. It‚Äôs embarrassing and discouraging when something like this happens. He spent the two hours of rehearsal time sitting in the hallway refusing to participate.

We all go through these kinds of situations. I think the key to getting through is to spend our time and energy focused not on the larger situation but on the things we can control.

So what exactly *is* in our control?

- ‚Ä¢ Our emotions
- ‚Ä¢ Our judgements
- ‚Ä¢ Our creativity
- ‚Ä¢ Our attitude
- ‚Ä¢ Our perspective
- ‚Ä¢ Our desires
- ‚Ä¢ Our decisions
- ‚Ä¢ Our determination


Pretty much everything else is outside of our control. But look at all we *do* have control over! This list encompasses so much. If we all learned to control even a sliver of this we would be unshakable.

I hope the young man decides that he is going to go forward and grasp this opportunity. This could be an important turning point for him. We rarely have control of the auditions in life but we do have control of our actions after. Taking control of those things we can control makes all the difference.
