We all know we need it, but it’s so easy to have a bad relationship with sleep. We’ve all decided to stay up late or get up early. Life is hectic and sometimes it feels like sleep is the easiest block of time to compromise with. Don’t do it!

If you have the Calm app there’s an excellent session by LeBron James called “The Power of Sleep” in the Train Your Mind course. I think I learned more from listening to LeBron talk about how vital sleep is than from anyone else.

Unfortunately that's gated content so not everyone will be able to listen to it. Here are some interesting articles I recently read that might be helpful as well. If you get into them you’ll see the common theme: all humans need eight or more hours of sleep to optimally function.

- [The Science of Sleep: A Brief Guide on How to Sleep Better Every Night by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/sleep)
- [How Do I Sleep Better? The Ultimate Guide for Improving Sleep by Steve Kamb](https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/are-you-making-these-mistakes-with-your-sleep/)

The things that have helped me most are getting to bed before 10 pm each night, no screens for an hour before bed, and reading a novel for a few minutes before I fall asleep.
