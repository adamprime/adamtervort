      <description>It’s the nature of being human that we will have bad days. And sometimes bad weeks. Or bad months. Maybe even bad years.
The list of things that can go wrong or happen to us seems endless. (Not trying to be a downer here, but it’s true!) There is real pain and suffering in the world and it happens to me and you.
The good news is that we are never alone and that we always have a choice.</description>
