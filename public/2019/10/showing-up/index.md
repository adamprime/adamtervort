# The Profound Power in Showing Up


All skills, habits, hobbies, and jobs that are worth doing take time and repetition. They don‚Äôt come easily or without effort.

The process of acquiring these skills can be monotonous. Write 500 words. Throw 50 changeups. Create a lesson plan. Play your scales. Cook pasta. Repeat tomorrow and the next day and the next. It takes thousands of repetitions before something amazing happens, before the work becomes art. We usually don‚Äôt know exactly when the magic will happen and the wait can be tough.

Showing up to practice is so important. We‚Äôre all striving to make different kinds of art. The thing we have in common is that the only way to get there is to show up over and over again. We have to try and fail and improve, then try some more. It won‚Äôt be easy. Great journeys never seem to be. 

Each time we show up is another vote cast for who we want to be.

I think something else happens when we show up consistently. We gradually conquer our fear, our pride, and our weakness. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Äù becomes ‚ÄúI can, and here‚Äôs how I know.‚Äù The record we build for ourselves fundamentally changes who we are. It gives us the strength to overcome in the most important battles we fight, inside our mind.

Start small. Tie your practice to something you already do consistently. Keep track of how you show up. The progress will come in much bigger ways that you anticipate.
