      <description>As I write this I’m listening to three student jazz groups playing. (I have one child in each group so I sit in between the three rehearsal rooms so I can catch snatches of each group as they play.)
Last week these groups held auditions. One of the students who auditioned got his placement today and wasn’t willing to accept it. He is the oldest bass player that tried out but was placed in the lowest of the three groups.</description>

      <description>It’s the nature of being human that we will have bad days. And sometimes bad weeks. Or bad months. Maybe even bad years.
The list of things that can go wrong or happen to us seems endless. (Not trying to be a downer here, but it’s true!) There is real pain and suffering in the world and it happens to me and you.
The good news is that we are never alone and that we always have a choice.</description>
